<h1>What is a leap year?</h1>
<hr>
<p>Years are longer than 365 days, so to account for it, we add leap years, which are years that have 1 extra day if the year is divisible by 4, and end-of-century years that are divisible by 400. Because of this, your birthday is probably a few days off of what you were told it is.</p>
